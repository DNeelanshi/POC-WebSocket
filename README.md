Basically, we create two projects:

notification-service (backend): This project is used to develop WebSocket endpoint at server side using spring boot, STOMP and sock js support.
angular-component(frontend): This project is used to develop single page application using Angular 8 as front-end technology. This Angular 8 client application subscribes and exchanges the messages over a WebSocket.
