# POC-WebSocket
Basically, we  create two projects:
springboot-websocket (backend): This project is used to develop WebSocket endpoint at server side using spring boot, STOMP and sock js support.
angular8-springboot-websocket(frontend): This project is used to develop single page application using Angular 8 as front-end technology. This Angular 8 client application subscribes and exchanges the messages over a WebSocket.
